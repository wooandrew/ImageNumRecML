## Abstract
This programming challenge is my introduction to AI, or more specifically, the machine learning aspect of AI. It will attempt to correctly classify hand-written numbers using [Multilayer Perceptron][multilayer-perceptron]. This challenge is an attempt to put into practice [3Blue1Brown's][3b1b] example in his [Neural Network Series][3b1b-series] from scratch. The language of choice for this challenge is Python, as it is widely considered the "best" option for machine learning and AI. The libraries used within will change as the challenge progresses. C++ was not chosen due to its low level status, as it would be too difficult to implement many of the necessary features as compared to Python.

The purpose of this document is simply to organize my thoughts into a single location. It thus acts as my documentation for this challenge/project.
